# Obsidian_Public

## Description
This is my public repo of templates for free use and modification by anyone. This is heavily inspired by the posts listed below. You'll most likely have to delete the 'new meeting' button and create your own as described in the link for the meeting note template 

## My Use Case
I work in R&D, and was looking for a all-in-one tool for personal notes, meeting notes, experiment planning, and task tracking where I could link different references and have tasks listed in meetings automatically tracked in my daily planner. The templates listed above were an excellent starting point that I modified to fit my personal needs.
